### DNS Providers

Without using a secure, privacy-centric DNS all your web requests can be
seen in the clear. You should configure your DNS queries to be managed by
a service that respects privacy and supports DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt.

- **[<img src='https://developers.cloudflare.com/assets/icon-512x512-fe4c8fe4.png' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1)** - One of the most performant options, Cloudflare's DNS supports DoH and DoT, and has a Tor
implementation, providing world-class protection. They have native cross-platform apps,
for easy set-up.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> Using an encrypted DNS resolver will not make you anonymous, it just makes
it harder for third-partied to discover your domain history.
If you are using a VPN, take a [DNS leak test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/),
to ensure that some requests are not being exposed.

> #### DNS Protocols

DNS-over-TLS was proposed in [RTC-7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)
by the IETF, then 2 years later, the DNS-over-HTTPS specification was outlined
in [RFC8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484) in October '18.
[DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), is a protocol that authenticates communications
between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing, through
using cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the
chosen DNS resolver, and haven't been tampered with. DNSCrypt is a well
battle-tested protocol, that has been in use since 2013, and is still widely used.

from a client machine (desktop or laptop) to a DNS Privacy resolver increasing end user privacy.
Stubby can be used in combination with Unbound - Unbound provides a local cache and Stubby manages
the upstream TLS connections (since Unbound cannot yet re-use TCP/TLS connections),
see example configuration.
