### Encrypted Messaging

- **[<img src='https://signal.org/assets/images/favicon/android-chrome-192x192.png' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Signal](https://signal.org)** - Probably one of the most popular, secure private messaging apps that combines
strong encryption (see [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol))
with a simple UI and plenty of features. It's widely used across the world, and
easy-to-use, functioning similar to WhatsApp - with instant messaging, read-receipts,
support for media attachments and allows for high-quality voice and video calls.
It's cross-platform, open-source and totally free. Signal is
[recommended](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152)
by Edward Snowden, and is a perfect solution for most users.

- **[<img src='https://getsession.org/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Session](https://getsession.org)** - Session is a fork of Signal, however unlike Signal it does not require a mobile
number (or any other personal data) to register, instead each user is identified
by a public key. It is also decentralized, with servers being run by the community
though [Loki Net](https://loki.network), messages are encrypted and routed through
several of these nodes. All communications are E2E encrypted, and there is no
meta data.

- **[<img src='https://xmpp.org/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> XMPP](https://xmpp.org)** - XMPP, also known as Jabber, is an open standard for decentralized messaging that
has been widely used for decades. It has actually been the basis upon which
WhatsApp, Facebook's Chat and Google's Talk were built, but these companies
(eventually) chose to remove the interoperability with other servers. Prominent
XMPP clients support [OMEMO end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMEMO),
which is based on the [Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm)
that is used in Signal. For more hands-on information and to register an account
you can visit [JoinJabber](https://joinjabber.org).

- **[<img src='https://matrix.org/assets/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Matrix](https://matrix.org)** - Matrix is a decentralized open network for secure communications, with E2E
encryption with Olm and Megolm. Along with the [Element](https://element.io/)
client, it supports VOIP + video calling and IM + group chats. Since Matrix has
an open specification and Simple pragmatic RESTful HTTP/JSON API it makes it easy
to integrates with existing 3rd party IDs to authenticate and discover users, as
well as to build apps on top of it.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> Many messaging apps claim to be secure, but if they are not open source, then this cannot be verified - and they **should not be trusted**. This applies to [Telegram](https://telegram.org), [Threema](https://threema.ch), [Cypher](https://www.goldenfrog.com/cyphr), [Wickr](https://wickr.com/), [Silent Phone](https://www.silentcircle.com/products-and-solutions/silent-phone/) and [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), to name a few - these apps should not be used to communicate any sensitive data. [Wire](https://wire.com/) has also been removed, due to a [recent acquisition](https://blog.privacytools.io/delisting-wire/)

<summary>‚ú≥Ô∏è <b>Notable Mentions</b></summary>

> - [Chat Secure](https://chatsecure.org)
> - [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/) - Allows encrypted real-time chat, group chats, and public and private file sharing. It also has some nice features around cryptographically proving social identities, and makes PGP signing, encrypting and decrypting messages easy. However, since it was [acquired by Zoom](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom) in 2020, it has no longer been receiving regular updates.
> - [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org) - can be used over existing chat networks (such as email or message boards). It provides cryptographic privacy and authentication, PGP is used to encrypt messages.<br /> **Note/ Issues with PGP**  PGP is [not easy](https://restoreprivacy.com/let-pgp-die/) to use for beginners, and could lead to human error/ mistakes being made, which would be overall much worse than if an alternate, simpler system was used. Do not use [32-bit key IDs](https://evil32.com/) - they are too short to be secure. There have also been vulnerabilities found in the OpenPGP and S/MIME, defined in [EFAIL](https://efail.de/), so although it still considered secure for general purpose use, for general chat, it may be better to use an encrypted messaging or email app instead.
