### Encrypted Email

Email is not secure - your messages can be easily intercepted and read. Corporations scan the content of your mail, to build up a profile of you, either to show you targeted ads or to sell onto third-parties. Through the [Prism Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)), the government also has full access to your emails (if not end-to-end encrypted) - this applies to Gmail, Outlook Mail, Yahoo Mail, GMX, ZoHo, iCloud, AOL and more.<br><br> For a more details comparison of email providers, see [email-comparison.as93.net](https://email-comparison.as93.net/)

- **[<img src='https://tuta.com/resources/favicon/logo-favicon.svg' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Tuta](https://tuta.com)** - Free and open source email service based in Germany. It has a basic intuitive UI,
secure native mobile apps, anonymous signup, and a .onion site. Tuta has a
full-featured free plan or a premium subscription for businesses allowing for
custom domains ($12/ month). Tuta
[does not use OpenPGP](https://tuta.com/blog/posts/differences-email-encryption/)
like most encrypted mail providers, instead they use a standardized, hybrid method
consisting of a symmetrical and an asymmetrical algorithm (with 128 bit AES, and
2048 bit RSA). This causes compatibility issues when communicating with contacts
using PGP. But it does allow them to encrypt much more of the header data (body,
attachments, subject lines, and sender names etc) which PGP mail providers cannot do.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> - When using an end-to-end encryption technology like OpenPGP, some metadata
in the email header will not be encrypted.
- OpenPGP also does not support Forward secrecy, which means if either
your or the recipient's private key is ever stolen, all previous messages
encrypted with it will be exposed. You should take great care to keep your
private keys safe.
