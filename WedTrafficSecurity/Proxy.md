### Proxy Sites

A proxy acts as a gateway between you and the internet, it can be used to
act as a firewall or web filter, improves privacy and can also be used to
provide shared network connections and cache data to speed up common requests.
**Never use a [free](https://whatismyipaddress.com/free-proxies) proxy.**

<summary>⚠️ <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> [Malicious Proxies](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-edward_zaborowski-doppelganger.pdf) are all too common.
Always use open source software, host it yourself or pay for a reputable cloud service.
Never use a free proxy; it can monitor your connection, steal cookies and contain malware.
VPNs are a better option, better still - use the Tor network.
