### Self-Hosted Network Security

Fun little projects that you can run on a Raspberry Pi, or other low-powered computer. In order to help detect and prevent threats, monitor network and filter content

- **[<img src='https://technitium.com/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Technitium](https://technitium.com/dns)** - Another DNS server for blocking privacy-invasive content at its source. Technitium doesn't
require much of a setup, and basically works straight out of the box, it supports a wide
range of systems (and can even run as a portable app on Windows). It allows you to do some
additional tasks, such as add local DNS addresses and zones with specific DNS records.
Compared to Pi-Hole, Technitium is very lightweight, but lacks the deep insights that
Pi-Hole provides, and has a significantly smaller community behind it.
