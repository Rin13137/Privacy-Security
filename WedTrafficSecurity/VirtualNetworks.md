<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> - *A VPN does not make you anonymous - it merely changes your public IP address to that of your VPN provider, instead of your ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies / session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)*
- *Logging - If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider can see (and mess with) all your traffic. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this ([VPN leaks](https://vpnleaks.com/)). See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more*
- *IP Leaks - If configured incorrectly, your IP may be exposed through a DNS leak. This usually happens when your system is unknowingly accessing default DNS servers rather than the anonymous DNS servers assigned by an anonymity network or VPN. Read more: [What is a DNS leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html), [DNS Leak Test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com), [How to Fix a DNS Leak](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/how-to-fix-a-dns-leak.html)*
- *Stealth - It will be visible to your adversary that you are using a VPN (usually from the IP address), but other system and browser data, can still reveal information about you and your device (such as your local time-zone, indicating which region you are operating from)*
- *Many reviews are sponsored, and hence biased. Do your own research, or go with one of the above options*
- *Using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) (or another [Mix Network](/5_Privacy_Respecting_Software.md#mix-networks)) may be a better option for anonimity*

<summary>‚ú≥Ô∏è <b>Notable Mentions</b></summary>

> If you don't trust a VPN provider not to keep logs, then you could self-host your own VPN. This gives you you total control, but at the cost of anonymity (since your cloud provider, will require your billing info). See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand), to learn more, and get started with running a VPN. [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79) provides flexible, secure and easy Linux VMs, (from $0.007/hour or $5/month), Here is a [1-click install script](http://dovpn.carlfriess.com/)for on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3838338e7f79), by Carl Friess.
> Recently distributed self-hosted solutions for running your own VPNs have become more popular, with services like [Outline](https://getoutline.org/) letting you spin up your own instance and share it with friends and family. Since it's distributed, it is very resistant to blocking, and gives you world-wide access to the free and open internet. And since you have full control over the server, you can be confident that there is no logging or monitoring happening. However it comes at the cost of anonymity, especially if it's only you using your instance.</details>

<summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Further Info</b></summary>

> *While choosing a VPN, consider the following: Logging policy (logs are bad),
Jurisdiction (avoid 5-eyes), Number of servers, availability and average load.
Payment method (anonymous methods such as BTC, Monero or cash are better),
Leak protection (1st-party DNS servers = good, and check if IPv6 is supported),
protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard = good). Finally, usability of their apps,
user reviews and download speeds.*
