<summary>⚠️ <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> Flashing custom firmware may void your warranty.
If power is interrupted mid-way through a firmware install/ upgrade it
is possible for your device to become bricked. So long as you follow a
guide, and use a well supported system, on a supported router, than it
should be safe
