### File Encryption

- **[<img src='https://veracrypt.fr/favicon.ico' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr)** - VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use
it to either encrypt a specific file or directory, or an entire disk or
partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehensive encryption
options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable
edition. VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now deprecated) TrueCrypt.

- **[<img src='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11850518' width='16' height='16' alt='icon' /> Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org)** - Open source client-side encryption for cloud files - Cryptomator is geared
towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual
file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use, but has
fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with
VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works on Windows, Linux and Mac - but also has excellent
mobile apps.

<summary>⚠️ <b>Word of Warning</b></summary>

> Where possible, choose a cross-platform and well established encryption method, so that you are never faced with not being able to access your files using your current system.<br> Although well-established encryption methods are usually very secure, if the password is not strong, then an adversary may be able to gain access to your files, with a powerful enough GPU. If your system is compromised, then the password may also be able to be skimmed with a keylogger or other similar malware, so take care to follow good basic security practices

<summary>✳️ <b>Notable Mentions</b></summary>

> - [AES Crypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/) - A light-weight and easy file encryption utility. It includes applications for Windows, Mac OS, BSD and Linux, all of which can be interacted with either through the GUI, CLI or programatically though an API (available for Java, C, C# and Python). Although it is well established, with an overall positive reputation, there have been some [security issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/b7riov/aes_crypt_security_audit_1_serious_issue_found/) raised recently.
> - [CryptSetup](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup) - is a convenient layer for use on top of [dm-crypt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt). [EncFS](https://github.com/vgough/encfs) is a cross-platform file-based encryption module, for use within user local directories. [geli](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=geli&sektion=8) is a disk encryption subsystem included with FreeBSD.
> - [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) - is popular among Microsoft Windows and enterprise users, and provides fast, efficient and (if correctly configured) reasonably secure full drive encryption. However it is not open source, has poor compatibility with other operating systems, and has some very dodgy [defaults](https://www.diskcryptor.org/why-not-bitlocker/), which could lead to your system being compromised. Similarly, Apple's [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) on MacOS is easy and secure, but again, the source code is proprietary.
> - [DiskCryptor](https://www.diskcryptor.org/) - Windows-only, open source, file and volume encryption solution,
that makes a good alternative to BitLocker.
